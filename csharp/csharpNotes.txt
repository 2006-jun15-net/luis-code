Type safe language.
    Cannot change data type of variable alreday declared

Numeric data types:
    Int (4 bytes, between -2billion, and 2 billion)
    short (2 bytes)
    long (8 bytes)
    byte (1 byte)

    numbers with fractions: (Floating point number)
    Double(8 bytes, very wide range) Many digits of precision, but may breakdown and have rounding issues
    Float( 4 bytes, less precise)

Boolean data type:
    bool = true or false

    ex. bool mathWorks = (3 + 3 = 6); true

Text
    String (more than one character, use double quotes)
    Char (just one character, use single quotes)

Collections
    Arrays
        Int[], doube[], string[], etc.

    Several other types

Control Structures
    Let us run lines of code conditionally or repeatedly


c# architechture 
solutions (Bag of projects)
    Project(eg. HelloWorld)
        Class (ex. Program)
            method(ex. Main)

Project
    That is compiled by c# compiler, into assembly, followed by JIT (Just in time) compiler
    usually contains .cs pr .csproj file
    C#, F#, VB.NET, or other .NET language

assembly
    Doesn't run direct on computer but needs an environment (CLR [.NET runtime environment])
    .dll/ .exe file
    Written in intermediate language (aka CIL, IL, MSIL)

CLR
    contains JIT compiler
